# webUtils
This public repository hosts a package registry containing ``@mantisvision`` javascript libraries. Source codes of the hosted packages are located in a private MantisVision repositiry.
NPM packages can be downloaded from https://npm.pkg.github.com registry using the scope ``@mantisvision``. The main library ``@mantisvision/rysk`` is meant to be working alongside
[Three.js](https://threejs.org/) which is also listed as one of its dependencies.

## Installing a package in your project
You can install any of the published packages with its dependencies using either Yarn (v1 or v2) or NPM. You have to
specify the custom package registry for ``@mantisvision`` packages. For npm, you have to edit either your global or your
project's ``.npmrc`` file and add the following line:
```
@mantisvision:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```
For Yarn v1, you have to edit ``.yarnrc`` and add the following line:
```
"@mantisvision:registry" "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
```
For Yarn v2, you have to edit ``.yarnrc.yml`` and add the following:
```yaml
npmScopes:
  mantisvision:
    npmRegistryServer: "https://npm.pkg.github.com"
```
In order to install a specific package using NPM, run one of the following commands:
```
npm i @mantisvision/rysk
npm i @mantisvision/sentryintegration
```
If you prefer using Yarn, run one of the following:
```
yarn add @mantisvision/rysk
yarn add @mantisvision/sentryintegration
```
## Using a package in your source codes
### RYSK
This package exposes a single class as its default export. It can be imported in your javascript file like this:
```javascript
import Rysk from "@mantisvision/rysk" //javascript native module style
const Rysk = require("@mantisvision/rysk"); // Node.js style
```
In order to obtain a Three.js mesh, a new object of this imported class needs to be created:
```javascript
const ryskObj = new Rysk("video_url","data_url");
```
``data_url`` can point to data in one of these three formats:
* SYK1
* SYK2
* RYSK

The process of generating the Three.js mesh can be started by invoking ``run`` method on the object. It returns a promise
which resolves with the mesh:
```javascript
ryskObj.run()
	.then(mesh =>
	{ /* do something with the mesh */ })
	.catch(err => console.error(err));
```
The same mesh can be later (after invoking ``run``) obtained also by calling
```javascript
const mesh = ryskObj.getMesh();
```
In order to ensure the mesh is updated according to the new frames in the video, ``update`` method has to be called
periodically on the object. One option is to put it into the ``requestAnimationFrame`` callback like this:
```javascript
const animate = () =>
{
	requestAnimationFrame(animate);
	ryskObj.update();
};
requestAnimationFrame(animate);

```
There is no need to call ``getMesh`` after each update because it is the original mesh which gets modified according to
new frames from video and new SYK/RYSK data.

At the end of the lifecycle, it is highly recommended to call ``dispose``Â on the rysk object in order to free the system
resources
```javascript
ryskObj.dispose();
ryskObj = null;
```
The full example of usage may look like this:
```javascript
import Rysk from "@mantisvision/rysk"

const ryskObj = new Rysk("video_url","data_url");

const animate = () =>
{
	if (ryskObj !== null)
	{
		requestAnimationFrame(animate);
		ryskObj.update();
	}
};

ryskObj.run().then(mesh =>
	{
		requestAnimationFrame(animate);

		/* do something with the mesh */

		ryskObj.dispose();
		ryskObj = null;
	}).catch(err => console.error(err));
```
### SentryIntegration
This package exposes a single class as its default export. It can be imported in your javascript file like this:
```javascript
import SentryIntegration from "@mantisvision/sentryintegration" //javascript native module style
const SentryIntegration = require("@mantisvision/sentryintegration"); // Node.js style
```
Instance of this class can be injected into Sentry during its init state:
```javascript
import * as Sentry from "@sentry/browser";
import SentryIntegration from "@mantisvision/sentryintegration";

Sentry.init({
	integrations: [new SentryIntegration({ measure:true })],
	/* the rest of Sentry config */
});
```
Constructor of exported class can called with a single parameter which contains settings object. Currently, the only
available option is ``measure`` which can be set to ``true`` or ``false`` to turn on/off sending of the statistics to
Sentry.
### Utils
Exports from this package are meant only for internal usage by other ``@mantisvision`` libraries.
## Public API
This is a description of methods and their parameters which are exported for direct use from individual packages:
### RYSK
``@mantisvision/rysk`` exports a single class as a default export with following methods:
```javascript
/**
 * Creates new instance of the class, but doesn't start downloading the data yet.
 * @param {String} videourl url of the video to be downloaded
 * @param {String} dataurl url of the RYSK/SYK data
 */
constructor(videourl,dataurl)
```
```javascript
/**
 * Runs the service and returns a promise which resolves with a three.js mesh.
 * @returns {unresolved} THREE.Mesh when the promise is resolved, null if an error occurs (e.g. incorrect URL).
 */
async run();
```
```javascript
/**
 * Gets mesh. Must be called after run!
 * @returns {THREE.Mesh|null} if the method is called before run or after dispose, it returns null.
 */
getMesh();
```
```javascript
/**
 * Updates mesh to reflect the current video frame and frame data. To ensure the mesh is trully updated, this method
 * must be called periodically (e.g. in requestAnimationFrame callback).
 * @returns {undefined}
 */
update();
```
```javascript
/**
 * Pauses download of the video and RYSK/SYK data, as well as audio. Therefore, the mesh will not change even if
 * update is called. This method is asynchronous because internally it calls pause on HTML video element which returns
 * a promise.
 * @returns {unresolved} the promise from HTML video elem pause call.
 */
async pause();
```
```javascript
/**
 * Plays the video and continues downloading RYSK/SYK data. This method is asynchronous because internally it calls play
 * on HTML video element which returns a promise.
 * @returns {unresolved} the promise from HTML video elem play call.
 */
async play();
```
```javascript
/**
 * Sets the volume of the audio. This might not work as expected on some mobile devices, however, setting volume to 0 should
 * always mute the video.
 * @param {double} volume number between 0 (muted) and 1 (full).
 */
setVolume(volume);
```
```javascript
/**
 * Checks whether the video is paused.
 * @returns {Boolean} true if it is, false otherwise.
 */
isPaused();
```
```javascript
/**
 * Registers a callback on an event type. Currently, the only supporter event are error and video.ended
 * @param {string} event name of the event type (either error or video.finished)
 * @param {callable} callback
 * @returns {undefined}
 */
on(event,callback);
```
```javascript
/**
 * Unregister a callback for an event type
 * @param {string} event event name of the event type (either error or video.ended)
 * @param {type} callback callback
 * @returns {undefined}
 */
off(event,callback);
```
```javascript
/**
 * It is highly recommended to call this method after the work is finished in order to free the resources. It terminates
 * downloading of SYK/RYSK data, stops the video and disposes geometry and material of three.js mesh.
 */
dispose();
```
### SentryIntegration
Exports a single class as its default export. An instance of this class should be passed to Sentry during its
configuration. Method ``setupOnce`` is called automatically by Sentry.
```javascript
/**
 * Creates an instance of this calss which should be passed to Sentry.
 * @param {Object} options configuration object which currently supports only one parameter:
 *					measure -- if set to true, Transactions will be allowed in SentryInternal package, if false they won't
 */
constructor(options = null)
```
